## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
+ Seeking out challenges is how growth is acheived.  Being afraid of it keeps you in your comfort zone.
+
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
+ I do in my hobbies by trying things between 80% of my limit for growth in repetition, and dedicate time at my full limit each week too.
+ I don't show growth mindset in being effective at asking for help.  It is something I am working on.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
+ It forced Google searching and a lot of trial and error in my terminal commands.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
+ Conditionals look against given variables and give instruction if they do or do not line up.  If the variables in the code do, it will yield an output, if they do not, it will give further instruction from there.
5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
+ `else if`.  If the original `if` statement does not match the given variable, it will run to the next line of code until it matches the `else if` statement.  If none of the given `else if` statements match, there should be an `else` statement.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
+ `&&` or `||`

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
+ Are there situations where there are dozens of `if` statements?  How does this scale?
