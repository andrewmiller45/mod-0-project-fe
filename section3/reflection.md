## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
+ Overall it felt fine.  There were a few key resources that I heavily relied on for success (the youtube video)

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
+ Spotify has to use them all over the place in the massive amounts of playlists they create,
album lists, etc.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
+ Array methods are ways to manipulate and get information on data that exists within a given array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
+ Loops are ways to automate multiple lines of code with a single command.  I would use loops when I need to do a repetitive task many times over, such as when I am dealing with a large amount of data in an array.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
+ Andrew and His dog want to know how old they are in total.  
+ Write `sum` on the white board and leave it blank
+ Add Andrew's age to the board
+ Add Yeti's age to the board
+ It would be hard to do this with a hundred people, so instead of adding each one on our own, we have a computer add our ages up instead of writing it ourselves on the whiteboard.  Loops are what happen when you do the same task over and over.


6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
+ This felt much more abstract than the other items.  Do these become more practical with more knowledge or will they remain/feel abstract?
