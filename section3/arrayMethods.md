# Explaining Array Methods
1. .pop
+ This removes the last variable from inside an array, and shows the value that was removed.  

2. .push
+ This adds a given variable at the end of an array, and shows the amount of values in the array.

3. .shift
+ I see this as the opposite of .pop.

4. .unshift
+ This adds variables to the front of an array, and shows the new length of the array.
