## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
+ I feel a bit hesitant in the zoom calls, as I feel we are strapped for time during the mod0 time.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
+ I learned about strings, which is to be interpreted as textual.  They are required to be closed off in quotations.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
+ console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
+ //
+ This tells the software not to act on the input after the `//`

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
+ A variable is an item to use, but can change in the future.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
+ Instagram
+ Username - string
+ Private/public Account - boolean
+ Likes count - number

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
+ Concatenation takes multiple strings and variables, and combine them.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
+ Instagram
+ Probably in the notification where they say (username) + liked your photo with a thumbnail of your photo in it.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
+ Does interpolation get used more than concatenation?
